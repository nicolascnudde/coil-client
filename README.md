# COIL Project: Farmers without Borders

## About

For this assignment, we’ve developed a responsive web application in React. We opted for creating a delivery app.

Since security and privacy are important factors nowadays, we paid a lot of attention to things such as data validation and form input and submits. This assignment was in association with students from Seneca College based in Toronto, Canada.

## Goal

Our goal is to connect small local farmers and producers to urban communities by providing a fresh and local alternative to big chain grocery outlets. We have a wide selection of local produce that is delivered right to your doorstep. There’s no longer a barrier to good and healthy food. We believe that organic and local produce is for everyone. You deserve to eat better.
